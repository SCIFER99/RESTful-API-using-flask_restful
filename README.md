# RESTful-API-using-flask_restful
This is another basic RESTful API using flask_restful  

It's me again! Here to bring you another basic RESTful API demonstrating the structure
of a RESTful API! 

Step1: Install these packages for best results:

       pip3 install flask (if you have not done so already)
       pip3 install Resource
       pip3 install API
       pip3 install flask_restful 
       pip3 install request (if you have not done so already)
       
Step2: That is all! 

Happy Coding!
